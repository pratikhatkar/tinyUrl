Tiny Url
--------


Prerequisites and assumptions:
------------------------------

1. Working Play framework installation.
2. In memory database using H2. Each time you launch TinyUrl application, a new in memory database is created.


Project creation and launch:
----------------------------

1. Unzip project.
2. In project folder /tinyUrl, on command line type 'play'.
3. Type 'compile' to compile the project.
4. Type 'test' to execute all tests.
5. Type 'run' to launch project.
6. Visit 'http://localhost:9000/' on browser.
7. Click 'Apply this script now!' to apply database schema patch.
8. TinyUrl is ready to be used.


Approach:
---------

1. Simple UI to take two inputs. One input takes the original url and return the tiny url. Second input takes the tiny
   url and redirect page to original url.
2. For an original url, if tiny url is created return the created tiny url. If not, create a new one.
3. This application uses in memory database H2, but can easily be replaced by MySql or Cassandra instance.
4. For every new original url, internally application generates id and associate the original url with id.
   This id is nothing but the new tiny url.
